# Arvato-segmentation

## Customer Segmentation and Prediction

### Project Overview
This project aims to develop a customer segmentation report for Arvato Financial Services by analyzing demographic data of a German mail-order company's customers compared to the general population. The project involves using unsupervised learning to identify segments and supervised learning to predict potential customers.

### Features and Technologies Used

** Principal Component Analysis (PCA): For reducing dimensionality of the dataset.
** K-Means Clustering: For segmenting customers into distinct groups.
** Gradient Boosting Classifier: Used in predictive modeling to forecast potential customer behavior.
** Python Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
