Features and Technologies Used
Principal Component Analysis (PCA): For reducing dimensionality of the dataset.
K-Means Clustering: For segmenting customers into distinct groups.
Gradient Boosting Classifier: Used in predictive modeling to forecast potential customer behavior.
Python Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
